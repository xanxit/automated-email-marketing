# Mail Scheduling Web App 

 We have made a mail scheduler which will schedule the mail for the users, at a particular time and date which could be easily rescheduled as per user convinience. User can log in through normal email and password, whereas one can even use their Google account for accessing the website.

## WebApp Link : 

 Our webApp contains basically 4 major routes
## 1) Create a Scheduled mail

Here the user can give the basic details to the user who'll recieve the email and the subject alongside with the body and images and the reciever would get the emails as per the scheduled time.
The UI would look something like this:



## 2) See previously Scheduled mail

Here the user can get the previously scheduled mail that were previously done by the user.
The UI would look something like this:



## 3) See the scheduled mail 

Here the user could see their scheduled mail.
The UI would look something like this:



## 4) Update the earlier scheduled mail

Here the user could update the data of the mail scheduled.

The UI would look something this :



# How to run on Local host!!!

Instructions:

> First you will need to clone the repository from github. The command used will be as follows:
	git clone https://github.com/xanxit/CrashXDeveloper.git 

> This will create a cloned repository in your local storage. Now you need the node modules. 

> Navigate to the folder where the repository is cloned and inside this location write this command:
	npm install

> After this navigate to the client folder like so: cd client
Then you need to write this command here to get node modules for frontend

To run the application follow these steps:

> Now navigate back to the main folder where cloned repository is stored using -> cd..

> To run backend sever use the command "npm start" in this location in the terminal

> To run frontend sever use the command "npm start" inside client folder in the terminal (to navigate to client folder from main folder use "cd client")

Now, you're ready to go!
